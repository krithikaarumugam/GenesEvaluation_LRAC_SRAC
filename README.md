Function to check Gene Quality in LRAC (Long Read Assembled Chromosome) based on genes in cognate SRAC bin (Short Read Assembled Contigs). The idea is to test if genes/proteins predicted on
#LRAC map to genes/proteins predicted in cognate SRAC bin. We are using pseudo-coordinates here (i.e. the midpoints of genes) 
Also test the following,
